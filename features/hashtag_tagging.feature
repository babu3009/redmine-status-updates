Feature: Hashtag tagging
  As a user
  I want to use hashtags
  So I can categorize status updates

  Scenario: Hashtags link to the Hashtag page
    Given I am logged in
    And I am a member of a project
    And there are "3" statuses with a Hashtag of "#business"
    And I am on the Status page for the project

    When I follow "#business"

    Then I am on the "#business" Hashtag page for the project

  Scenario: Hashtag page showing message for a Hashtag
    Given I am logged in
    And I am a member of a project
    And there are "15" statuses with a Hashtag of "#business"
    And I am on the Hashtag page for "#business" on the project

    Then I should see "15" updates
